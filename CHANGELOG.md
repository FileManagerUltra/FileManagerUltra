## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04

First public release (beta).

### Added

- Web links in the terminal open in your browser with Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS).
- Links in the Markdown preview are clickable. Web and mail links open externally; relative links such as `docs/install.md` open the folder in a Files pane and select the file.
- Markdown files can be viewed as source: the "Preview" toolbar button toggles between the rendered document and the highlighted text (also in the View menu).
- Preview source picker numbers the file panes.
- Thumbnail view can be sorted by name, modified date or type. With subfolders included, files are grouped under a heading per subfolder (switchable to one flat list) and folder tiles are no longer shown.

### Changed

- FileManagerUltra is now licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (previously MIT).
- The log filter bar is shown by default when previewing a log.
- The Diff toolbar shows a single "Diff" toggle for every file except Markdown, instead of a Preview/Diff pair whose Preview button did nothing.

### Fixed

- Thumbnail view in the preview no longer lists hidden files and folders while "Show hidden files" is off.
- Toggling hidden files keeps the cursor on the same file instead of jumping to the top.
- Light theme no longer shows dark bars around the panels.
- The whole path bar, not just the text, can be clicked to edit the path.
- Folders created outside the app (for example by `git clone` in a terminal) now appear in the file tree right away, also under tree folders that are not the pane's current folder.
- Restored workspaces show the folder tree from the filesystem root again, instead of starting at the home folder.
- A failed automatic update check no longer shows an error bar at startup; a manual check explains when GitHub is rate limiting requests.

### Removed

- macOS Intel (x64) release builds; Apple has deprecated the platform.

### Documentation

- macOS install notes: clear the quarantine flag on the downloaded `.dmg` (`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`), as the app is not yet signed or notarized.
